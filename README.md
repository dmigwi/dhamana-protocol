### Introduction

[Dhamana](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dhamana) is a swahili word with arabic origins that means __"*to offer guarantee*"__. **Dhamana-protocol** is a system where people unknown to each other but approved by a reputable 3rd party, engage in a discussion on how one of them will offer a (bond) security in exchange for financial support **(Crypto/Fiat)** on a project or an idea they are passionate about. 
The bond issuer, initiates the conversation by describing the principal, interest rate, security e.t.c.(bond details) with a view that one of the people interested will agree on their terms and subscribe to their bond.
The system allows people to make legal binding agreements that can be used to seek legal redress should one of the parties fall short of their expectations.
Once the terms are agreed upon, financial transactions are done outside dhamana-protocol just as parties to the bond have agreed.
